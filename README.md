# Transformers Explained

Welcome to the "Transformers Explained" repository! This project aims to demystify the Transformer architecture, a groundbreaking model that has revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and beyond.

Whether you're a curious beginner or an experienced practitioner looking to deepen your knowledge, this repository offers a comprehensive and hands-on approach to understanding Transformers. We'll explore fundamental concepts, the attention mechanism, and even build a Transformer from scratch.

## Introduction to Transformers

This section provides an overview of the Transformer architecture, its history, and its significance in the NLP domain. We'll cover key concepts such as positional encoding, encoder and decoder blocks, and how Transformers have overcome the limitations of recurrent and convolutional models.

## The Attention Mechanism

At the core of Transformers lies the attention mechanism, especially self-attention. This section will explain in detail how attention allows the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence during prediction, thereby capturing long-range dependencies.

## Building a Transformer from Scratch

For a deeper understanding, we will build a simplified Transformer using popular deep learning libraries. This hands-on approach will help you grasp the intricacies of each component and how they interact.

## Fine-Tuning Transformers

Pre-trained Transformer models have become the standard for many NLP tasks. This section will cover fine-tuning techniques, showing how to adapt these powerful models to specific tasks with smaller datasets.

## Installation
