    "# The Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second notebook in the “Transformers Explained” series! In this notebook, we dive into the core of Transformer architecture: the attention mechanism, especially self-attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, attention is a mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input (or output) sequence when making a prediction. This enables the model to focus on the most relevant parts instead of treating everything equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Attention Mechanism](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Attention-mechanism-01.svg/1280px-Attention-mechanism-01.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention is a type of attention where the model learns the relationships between different positions in the *same* sequence. This means each word can \"look at\" other words in the sentence to better understand its context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention computes three vectors for each input word:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query (Q)** – What the word is looking for.\n",
    "2. **Key (K)** – What the word offers.\n",
    "3. **Value (V)** – The actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of self-attention are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute similarity scores** between Query and all Keys (dot product).\n",
    "2. **Scale** the scores by \\( \\sqrt{d_k} \\).\n",
    "3. **Apply softmax** to get attention weights.\n",
    "4. **Weight the Values** using the attention weights to get the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( Q \\): Query matrix\n",
    "- \\( K \\): Key matrix\n",
    "- \\( V \\): Value matrix\n",
    "- \\( d_k \\): Key dimension\n",

    "\n",
    "## Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-head self-attention performs multiple attention operations in parallel (called “heads”). Their results are concatenated and linearly transformed. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
